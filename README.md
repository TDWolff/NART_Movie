## What our project is about!
Our project is a movie database, similar to IMDB, but in a more simpler form. We have incorporated by using javascript and html with css for the background while using python and AWS for our backend.
- Our github pages is published at https://tdwolff.github.io/NART_Movie/

## How we can up with this idea
For our team teach we have come up with the idea of a movie database. We have then for our final project decided to incorporate to a wide variety of movies compared to our low 50 movies. We are expanding it so we have have a better recommendation system and just better than what it was before. 

### AWS requirements
- We have used AWS in order to power the backend of our website
> We have successfully used AWS in the following
- Encoding API for OMDB
- Sign in Page

### Front End 
- Our front end has also gotten significantly better as it used to be just the default layout, we have changed it so it has a little bit of a cyber punk style. We then decided that simplicity is the key and therefore a gradient background would be best to implement. 
- We have also been doing a new recommendation system in which it recommends movies based on the year of their thearatical release. The OMDB library does not have gnere therefore we cannot incorporate a recommendation system by genre so we had to work with what we got. 

### Preview
- The github site will contain many different things ranging from, movie search, cool background and a recommendation system which goes by year.
