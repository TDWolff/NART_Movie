    "Variables are considered abstraction as they assign a value to another value. In other words, they basically describe values to each other. Variables are important as it can be used in many different uses such as they can store useful information, especially if you have a long lines of code. Variables are mostly used to store data such as numbers (we are going to go over integers today), booleans, lists, strings and dictionaries.  \n",

    " * highScore is a better and shorter way of saying highestScoreInTheGame\n",
    "\n",
