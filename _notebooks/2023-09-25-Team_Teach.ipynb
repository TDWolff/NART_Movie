    "Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user. Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter). You can also use the abstract keyword to create abstract methods that must be overridden in the subclass.You do this by putting information in lists, dictionaries, and objects. You can also create your own data types using classes. This is called data abstraction. Here is an example of data abstraction:"
